I waffled on building this site for years. Then I waffled on publishing it for more years.

My initial excuse was that I had been away from The Internet™ for too long. 

I don't mean that I wasn't online at all. We've all been online for years, whether we want to be or not. What I mean is The Internet™ from when there was a lot more friction to getting online, circa 1998, including a hard-wired phone line, which meant if you wanted to be online you _really_ had to want to be online. That was when I started building websites. 

Many pieces of the internet that feel ubiquitous today didn't exist at that time, or existed only in their most rudimentary forms:
- **Social media:** I remember when Twitter launched and it was presented as "microblogging", and Facebook was presented as a virtual replacement to the "freshman facebook"
- **Git:** version control was all manual, at least for what I was doing, which was essentially front end web development. If I changed something and broke my site, it was very hard to troubleshoot
- **Static site generators:** I initially would upload everything manually through FTP, then eventually used a content management system called Greymatter, then later another one called Movable Type (choosing and learning how to use a SSG is what was the hardest to learn this time around)
- **SVGs:** vector graphics may have existed, but the more common formats for displaying images were JPEG, BMP, and GIF. We didn't even have PNG back then. 
- **Mobile web:** smartphones definitely did not exist (remember, we were using dial-up to get online), and the default screen resolution most of us designed for was 800 x 600.

At the risk of being Grandpa shaking his fist at the kids on the lawn, I do think the internet was better back then in a lot of ways, mostly because we weren't all trying to make money off of it, and oddly, because it wasn't so easy to
