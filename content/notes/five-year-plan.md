The other day while waiting out a tropical storm (that just ended up being a lot of rain) I picked a book off the shelf, Designing Your Life, which has an exercise in it that involves planning three alternate versions of the next five years of your life. I always thought the "five year plan" was kind of an arbitrary amount of time for planning and it's hard to believe it could be universal, but when I look back on my adult/professional life, it does seem to be organically separated into chunks of about 3-6 years: 
- Undergrad: 4 years
- Medical school: 4 years
- First half of residency, including research year: 3 years
- Second half of residency: 3 years
- First job out of residency: 3 years
- Current job: 1.5 years
