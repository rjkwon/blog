If you're pre-med before medical school, are you post-med after?

When you're a baby, you pass major milestones every day or every week[^1]. Then, every month or every year. As a working adult, life (and career) seems to happen in chunks of 3â€“5 years, ish.

When I was pre-med, I thought my life/career would look like this:
- College, 4 years
- Medical school, 4 years
- Residency, 5 years
- Fellowship, 1-3 years
- Surgeoning, forever, until I die &larr; *post-med starts here*

Instead, what happened was/is this:
- College, 4 years
- Medical school, 4 years
- Residency, 5 years, plus one year of research
- Unemployment, 3 months &larr; *post-med starts here*
- First startup job, independent contracting, 3 years
- Second startup job,
