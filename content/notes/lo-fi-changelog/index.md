I made a [changelog](https://github.com/rjkwon/personal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). 

This was a fun little morning project for me. I've seen others do a thing where the changelog is simply a list of all commit messages in reverse chronological order, so I decided to try it. With any "small" coding project, I find that I generally grossly underestimate the time it will take to accomplish a seemingly simple thing, but I learn a lot and also have fun with all the side quests.

In this case, I did some googling and found some articles [this Free Code Camp article is the main one I used](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-git-what-is-a-changelog-and-how-to-generate-it/), and immediately found out I have been writing bad commit messages (apparently the best practice is to use the [imperative mood](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages), e.g. "add changelog", not the past tense, as I've been doing). Okay, noted!

Since my web skills are self taught, I am trying to be more intentional about identifying and developing good habits and hygiene with coding. (I feel like there is a parallel to surgery here, where even though the end result of a procedure by two different surgeons might look the same, the one who throws their stitches meticulously and ties their knots perfectly square has "better" techniqueâ€”although that might be less important for, say, a trauma laparotomy for a patient who's exsanguinating versus an elective plastic surgical procedure. Context matters. I wonder if it's the same with coding.)

I also read a little bit about [pretty formats for commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats).

In the end, this is where I ended up code-wise:

{{< highlight go "linenos=table,hl_lines=8 15-17,linenostart=1" >}}
git log --pretty=format:"* %as %s" > CHANGELOG.md
{{< / highlight >}}

which generated this: https://github.com/rjkwon/personal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

I like this solution for now because it's lightweight but does the job.

I also learned how to use the `highlight` [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) for displaying that code using Hugo. Now I just need to figure out where `blob` came from... and look into further automating this (potentially with a cron job?)... and maybe making it a page on the website instead of just a `.md` file...
