I spent a lot of time and energy in my life worrying about things I felt like I _had_ to do for one reason or another. Either everyone else was doing the thing, or specific people were pressuring me to do the thing, or I never saw real examples or models of people who _didn't_ do the thing, etc. 

At some point I started to realize that, if I really challenged myself, I didn't have to do some of the things I believed I had to in order to win at life (and I would include the idea of having to "win at life" on this list). I also couldn't really blame anyone for making the decisions that I did because I felt I had to; no one was forcing me to do these things. 

I mean, yes, societal pressure is very real, for some people more than others, and in some parts of the world it would be more than just frowned upon for me to not do some of these things. You know the allegory of the baby elephant tied to a stake with a rope, who even when he grows up and can easily break the rope, he doesn't, because he's been trained to believe he can't? I'm just trying to constantly remind myself that I can break the rope. 

**Things I don't have to do:**
