I keep an eye on the news through peripheral vision mostly but I noticed something about the confirmation hearings of the honorable Ketanji Brown Jackson that required my focus:

{{< figure src="../img/socks-full.png" caption="Hon. Ketanji Brown Jackson's husband" alt="Screenshot of a news image of a courtroom photo showing Hon.

No, not the husband. The SOCK:

I'm not quite sure what the design is (looks like some kind of illustration of a face), but what I do know is that it is a funky sock. Why is he wearing a funky sock?!

On further research (googling "Ketanji Brown Jackson husband"), I discover he is a surgeon.

Ahh, now it makes sense.

Why do surgeons wear funky socks? I used to wear a funky sock (two, even) in my OR days. It was because it was one of the few acceptable ways to show my personality in that setting. You're wearing the same scrubs as everyone else, your hair and face are covered, and, once you're scrubbed, your arms, hands, torso, lower body, basically everything is covered. Your socks are covered, tooâ€”but in your mind you know they are funky, and perhaps that is what gets you through the most stressful days.

Sidebar: I thought I remembered a website called surgsoxx.com or something like that from those days but it's possible that it was just a Twitter hashtag or that I am conflating it with throx.com, a site I heard about from a vascular surgeon who wore the funkiest socks I've seen to this day, and told me he used throx.com because they would send you three socks instead of two in a set, to account for inevitably losing one in the laundry, which I thought was a great idea. The closest thing to "surgsoxx" I could find today was a veterinary product called Surgi-sox, which, while not quite what I was looking for, was a delightful detour:

I mean, look at this list of indications.

Anyway. Surgeon socks!
