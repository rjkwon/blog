I made a page for my dad's collection of hats. It's an idea I had back in 2023 and as is my nature, it took me way too long and too much overthinking to get it to a shareable state. It's not finished, nor do I know what finished even means most of the time, and there are things I don't like about it that need to be fixed, but if there's one thing I know about myself, it's that I'll spin my wheels on the last 10% of a project that likely doesn't even matter in the grand scheme of things. So in an effort to embrace this discomfort, [here it is](https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/). I don't know what it's for â€” I guess just to share something I went through. I'm also trying to play around with more evergreen content in general, and am also experimenting with more reliable workflows for sharing photos/visuals. (This is also challenging and I'm struggling to make decisions but I'm documenting my thought process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0_FxxQm45FVvNV2VVJrvzUSpI95r4lttvi2wk3HMjs/edit?tab=t.yd8hhi20vc2). Work and think in public, I guess!!!
