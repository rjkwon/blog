Surgery and product management are not that different.

A doctor manages a condition, but doesn't manage the patient directly. A product manager manages the product (or feature) but doesn't manage people directly. So in both cases, you have to get buy-in from the patient or your teammates in order to get things done. The obvious difference is that a product manager *has* to influence without authority, whereas a doctor has a lot of authority that they can leverage to influence. But I'd argue that a good doctor doesn't play the authority card ("You should change your diet because I'm the doctor and I say so"). A good doctor could approach the issue with a product mindset and start by asking questions (and there are many, many good doctors who take this approach, especially in primary care where long term behavior change is key to health).
