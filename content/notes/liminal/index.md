Sometimes I walk around and do other things while brushing my teeth (which I know I'm probably not supposed to do but I do it anyway, like using Q-tips to clean my ears) and the other night I was winding down for the evening, brushing my teeth and zoning out while walking around the apartment and I noticed someone[^1] had left the light on in my home office and it kinda looked like a liminal space:

Neat.
