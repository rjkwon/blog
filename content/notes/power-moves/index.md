Yesterday one of my colleagues in a (virtual) meeting reportedly picked up a canister of coarse sea salt, announced "I'm just snacking," and proceeded to eat the salt, which confused and maybe frightened the other meeting attendees. 

It reminded me of the time I was rounding with my interns and medical students in the recovery room after scrubbing out of a long case and I was hungry so I pulled an apple out of my white coat pocket, ate most of it, noticed that there weren't any trash cans close by, and so I ate the core and seeds as well and then deposited the stem in the breast pocket of my white coat to discard later.

Years later, I found out that I scared the interns and students because they thought it was some kind of power move to assert dominance, because apparently I was making eye contact with them the whole time while ingesting the core and seeds.
