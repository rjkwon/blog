"Influence without authority" is a concept I only recently became aware of and have quickly fallen in love with. If it's possible to fall in love with a concept. (Maybe let's just say I have a crush on this concept. We've had some great dates, and I'd like to continue to get to know it better.) 

As a doctor, and *especially* as a surgeon, your influence is almost wholly due to authority. An <a href="">inherent power imbalance</a> separates you from your patients, both in that you have (1) years of formal medical knowledge and training, which your patient doesn't, and (2) literal physical power over your patient when they're under general anesthesia and you're operating on them. 

(Perhaps "power imbalance" is not quite the right term; medicine is already overly paternalistic with overly masculine phraseology. Asymmetry? There's an inherent *asymmetry* in which the patient is more vulnerable than the doctor. Yeah, that feels better.)

The really good doctors, though, are the ones who can appeal to *something else* besides authority in order to influence behavior. The specific *something else*s differ depending on the scenario but seem to generally fall into one a few buckets:

1. Appealing to the common goal
2. Sharing data to support your position
3. Showing that you care and are invested in success

One case sticks out in my mind as a clear example of a time I had to use all three to influence someone without using authority: the time my patient wouldn't let me save his life. 

(Dramatic pause, flashback music plays softly in the background, fog from fog machine fills the room as we travel back to 2013...)

I was a mid-level resident on call overnight at the city hospital. I got a call from a panicked medical resident that there was a patient with a pneumothorax seen on chest x-ray.

"Where is the patient? Is he stable? How bad is the pneumo? Is he tensioning? I'm on my way," I said in one breath, knowing that no matter what she said, I'd need to be in that patient's room sooner rather than later. I pulled up the chest x-ray on the computer while waiting for her response. 

"I... don't know," she replied sheepishly. "I haven't seen him or looked at the x-ray. I just got the call from radiology and paged you. He's in room 618, bed 3[^1]." I sighed loudly as I hung up the phone and mumbled something rude under my breath about medicine residents (sorry, medicine residents. I was very cranky in those days and I know you probably had 30 patients you were taking care of and were just as tired as I was). The x-ray was definitely a textbook pneumothorax -- half the left side of the chest was black instead of the usual soft grey and white lung markings, signifying a lot of air outside the lung that was squishing the lung and, without a bedside surgical intervention, would suffocate the patient. I speed-walked toward the elevator from my home base in the surgical ICU.

At the 6th floor nurses' station, I grabbed a consent form, knowing I'd need it for the procedure, and found the patient in room 618 pacing by his hospital bed, not in any visible respiratory distress to my moderately trained eye, but he was definitely very suspicious of me, and just seemed generally anxious.

I introduced myself and explained why I was there -- that I was from the surgery team and his medical doctor had called me because the chest x-ray was concerning for a collapsed lung, and that I'd need to ask him some questions and examine him, and potentially put a tube in his chest.

"Hell no," he said, turning away. "This hospital sucks. I came here because I ran out of my diabetes medicine and now they call the surgeon on me. I didn't even need that x-ray. There's nothing wrong with my lungs. Fuck that noise." 

How does one copulate with a sound?, I thought to myself. 

Out loud, I told him I was sorry to hear that, and that maybe nothing was wrong with his lungs, but that I was worried about the x-ray and wanted to make sure he was okay. 

In my head, I was getting as anxious as he looked, because although he didn't quite match the picture I had in my head based on the x-ray (I'd expected someone gasping for breath and essentially begging me to put in a chest tube), I didn't want to wait for him to be in such distress that the tube placement went from urgent to emergent. Also, I was significantly worried that he wouldn't sign the consent form.

This was truly a tough situation, because what do you do when someone needs help, it's your responsibility to help them, but they don't want your help? The more I talked to him, the more I realized he *was* in respiratory distress, only it was manifesting as anxiety, not tachypnea. And although I'd put in at least a hundred chest tubes by then, it'd be a lot harder with an awake patient who didn't want one placed. 

(When I relayed this story to a more senior colleague later, they retorted dryly, "It would've been a lot easier to put in that tube if you just waited for him to pass out." And in the moment, a small part of me was thinking the exact same thing.)

He continued to say that everything was fine, and for me to leave him alone. Finally, I just said, "Mr. X. You seem really anxious. Are you okay? I'm worried about you. Are you having trouble breathing?" He didn't answer, but looked up and made eye contact with me for the first time.

I had an idea.

I left the room and asked the patient's nurse if I could borrow her sacred COW[^2], which was a gamble. Thankfully, she graciously handed it over (albeit with a stern look that said "bring it back in 10 minutes or I'm going to come in there and take it from you," followed by her mouth saying the actual words "bring it back in 10 minutes or I'm going to come in there and take it from you").

I wheeled the COW into the patient's room and told him I wanted to show him something. He kept his distance but I could feel him watching behind me as I pulled up his x-ray.

"This is your x-ray," I said. I pointed to his name in the corner, then I pointed to the right lung field on the left side of the screen. "This is your right lung. It's like I'm facing you and taking a picture, so it's on the left side of the screen. This grey and white stuff is normal -- it means your right lung is filled with air." I pointed to the left lung field. "And this is your left lung. I'm really worried there was a bubble in your lung that popped, because now it's squished over here. It happens sometimes and when it does, the air leaks out and makes it hard for the person to breathe." I zoomed in and showed the edge of the compressed lung, a thin white line with a gentle curve.

I glanced over at him. Something shifted and I could tell he understood. 

"Does this make sense?" I almost whispered.

"Yeah," he said.

"Can I listen to your lungs?" I asked.

"Okay," he said.

I took my stethoscope out of my pocket. It was like the lungs had read the cheat sheet that the x-ray had written â€”- the right side had great lung sounds, and the left side was scarily quiet.

"I can help you breathe better," I said. "I can put a tube in your chest to suck out the air that's trapped, so your lung can fill up and you can breathe. I have to do it fast," I said. 

"Okay," he said quietly. By this point, he *was* starting to breathe a little more quickly. I knew we were running out of time. 

I wheeled the computer back to the nurse and asked her to witness the consent, then quickly grabbed all the supplies I needed and set up for the procedure. 

As soon as I got into the chest I heard the satisfying rush of air, he coughed a few times, and I asked him if his breathing was better. He said yes. 

I checked on him and his tube every day until it was ready to come out. I wish I could say that over that time he really warmed up to me and thanked me for saving his life, but he didn't. After the tube came out and a follow-up x-ray showed the lung was still up, surgery signed off the case, though he remained in the hospital under the medical team for blood sugar control. I would sometimes say hi

In his case, storming in and saying "I'm the surgeon and you're getting a chest tube whether you like it or not because it's good for you" would not have worked. (For the record, surgeons rarely speak those words verbatim, but if you've ever met a surgeon, that's often the general vibe they give off, and oftentimes it *does* work, for better or worse.)

I wish I knew for sure that showing him the x-ray (sharing the data) and appealing to our common goal (helping him not die) while also trying to convey that I cared about him having a good outcome were what changed his mind, but sometimes a small quiet part of me says it was only because he was suffocating and afraid that he eventually listened to what I had to say. I don't really know. 

Thankfully, in my current world, the stakes are never quite as high. And in business (and particularly when building digital products), there are often multiple possible solutions to a particular problem. You often even have the luxury of deciding whether something is a problem you want to chase down or not. 

[^1]: I made up the room number because I don't remember what it was, but I definitely remember it was bed 3, and I also definitely remember which lung was affected. I don't know why, but I often remember the most random anatomic + personal details about my patients, like that I removed the sigmoid colon of a man + the fact that the man owned a deli in Brooklyn and that he was in room 814. Also, note that I'm making up these details to protect the patients (as in maybe it was a liver segment of a woman who owned a nail salon in Queens who was in room 723 instead of a sigmoid colon of a man who owned a deli in Brooklyn in room 814) because I don't know how these people would feel about having their stories blasted on the internet.
