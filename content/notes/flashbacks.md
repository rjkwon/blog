Sometimes I randomly have flashbacks to things I havenâ€™t thought of in years, like Flagyl.

Besides the obvious things like breathing in fresh mountain air, riding my bicycle on a warm spring day, or plunging my hand into a large bag of cool dry white rice, one of the purest, simplest joys I have felt in my life was playing on the internet in my teens and early twenties.

(Wait. Is the rice thing just me?) 

The internet was relatively untouched by commerce in the early days. I would spend hours on the computer and to be honest I don't even remember all of the things I did, but probably around 15 or 16 I discovered weblogs. 

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was a little web designer and front end developer, mocking up designs in an unlocked pirated copy of Adobe Photoshop and writing basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a Windows program called CuteHTML (and uploading the contents of my site using a companion program called CuteFTP). 

It really was cute html, wasn't it? (Hehe.)

**Things that are different now from how they were then:**

* .nu domains were popular (and expensive). I don't know why. They just felt exotic.
* Mobile web and apps didn't exist. Everything was for desktop. (Somehow, even today I still really like a nice, roomy, thoughtfully laid-out desktop website.)
* I didn't have income, which means I used a lot of pirated software...
* CSS grid didn't exist.

A lot of the kids I came up with on the internet took a direct path to being designers at Google, product managers at Amazon, starting and exiting their own startups, etc. I left the internet for a few years (from 2010 to now, ish). More about that later.
