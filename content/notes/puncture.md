Last weekend we got a flat tire. The tire wasn't visibly low, but thank goodness for tire pressure monitoring systems—the dashboard instrument panel showed that the front left tire was at 15 psi, and the recommended tire pressure for our front tires is 37 psi. I was hoping maybe it was just cold out and the air had contracted (ambient temperature was in the 20s Fahrenheit), and that it would correct itself. No such luck. 

After some discussion and a quick stop for get soup dumplings (it was necessary), we drove to a tire shop in Bay Ridge. The tire guy graciously let us wait inside the shop, out of the cold, while he worked on replacing the tire. There was a giant tub full of slightly soapy water in the corner and as soon as I spotted it I instantly felt like I was teleported to a past life (and in a sense I was)—I knew exactly what that tub of water was for, even though I'd never seen a flat tire being replaced.

I was teleported back to identifying a hole in another hollow structure susceptible to puncture or perforation: intestine. (That escalated quickly.) Usually if you are taking a patient to the operating room for a suspected intestinal perforation, it's not hard to find the culprit, because a body with a functioning immune system will do what it can to wall off the hole, because it knows it doesn't want   All you had to do was fill a basin with saline and submerge the intestine, section by section, until the perforation declared itself, by means of bubbles in the saline.

This is also how you can find a hole in a bicycle tube that has been punctured, although an easier method sometimes is to simply re-inflate the tube, lift it to about 3 inches away from your mouth with both hands and pass it along between your hands until you feel air from the puncture site on your lips.
