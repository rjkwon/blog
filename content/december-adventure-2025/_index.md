I had a long workday and then went to a late (for me) dinner, so I didn't have as much time as I hoped for to work on Dec Adventure. Today, I fixed the mobile view for this page. Also, randomly, while waiting for my seat at the restaurant, I saw the actor Wallace Shawn come in, talk to the host (checking wait time?), and then leave. Inconceivable.

I have this micro-site, [kwon.nyc/cans](https://kwon.nyc/cans/), that I put together somewhat shoddily several weeks ago. It's a series of photos of craft beer cans with neat designs in reverse chronological order. Today I did some unglamorous code cleanup, including fixing a weird datetime issue where the "Last updated" date was referring to the date of the last site build -- now it refers to the date of the last can photo added, as desired. (Cue applause.)

**Goal for day 1 is to build this log.** I stumbled upon this December Adventure thing on Mastodon, and it feels like a nice way to make some progress on things with minimal pressure, which is the level I'm on these days. 

I built it as a custom micro-site within my existing Hugo site, which is somewhat against the spirit of Hugo sites (I think) but is super easy and fast to spin up by just creating a new content folder with `hugo new`, a baseof.html and list.html in a custom layout, and custom css.

This is also an interesting exercise in GOOD ENOUGH because it is not conducive to navel-gazing pixel pushing (unless said navel-gazing pixel pushing ends up as something tangible).
