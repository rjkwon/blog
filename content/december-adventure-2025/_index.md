Decided to break up the Alaska photos (from my <a href="#23">12/23 update</a>) into smaller galleries since I couldn't make enough decisions about which ones to cut. <a href="https://kwon.photos/alaska-2025-mendenhall-glacier/">Here's one</a> from Mendenhall glacier.

Took a long-ish Christmas walk around the lake. I made lions head meatballs for dinner.

I made a decaf coffee in the afternoon with a spoonful of hot cocoa mix and whipped cream. Decadent!

I've been culling a set of 566 photos from an Alaska trip to make into a gallery. I got it down to around 200, which is still too big for a gallery.

I made chicken and vegetable soup with the stock from yesterday. The plumber came by to fix a leak in the bathroom and kept saying how good the soup smelled so I gave him some to take home in a pint container.

Found a local grocery that sold handmade spaghetti in nests and guanciale, which is hard to find in stores, so I called my friend Steve who is in Bologna and asked for his carbonara recipe. We caught up for an hour and he shared the recipe.

Had a houseguest so spent most of the day entertaining. After dropping them off at the train station, I came back, broke down a chicken into parts, and used the bones to make a 4-hour stock.

Took my daily winter walk, at least. It rained so most of the snow on the trail melted. No creative brain.

<h1 id="18">18</h1>

Busy work day. No creative brain. Watched the first episode of the new season of Fallout.

<h1 id="17">17</h1>

Made hot pot at home. Finished jigsaw puzzle.

Made an open face kimchi tuna melt for lunch. This rental home also has a slow cooker and a jar of dried lentils, so I made a slow cooker lentil soup. Verdict: lentil soup doesn't need to be made in a slow cooker. Lol.

Busy work day. Took a winter walk on the rail trail. Shoveled snow. Felt good to see all the snow cleared when I was done.

Snow. Winter walk. Saw a porcupine. Made an Irish hot chocolate. Started a jigsaw puzzle.

Drove upstate. Quick winter walk in mid-afternoon before it got dark. 

<h1 id="12">12</h1>

Work from home, quick trip to office, packing for a month upstate. No creative brain today.

Travel day, inbound flight home. SFO Terminal 1 has a Vietnamese spot so I had a sidecar of pho broth for breakfast, and now I want a sidecar of pho broth for breakfast every day.

Work trip day 2. Made a bakery with modeling clay baked goods with my niece, called the Feed Me Bakery. "Expensive stuff" in the back (niece's idea).

Work trip day 1. Took a morning walk at the coastal wetlands on the way to the office and pondered this interesting bush-looking plant.

Travel day, sat on a plane for 6 hours on an outbound flight for a work trip. No creative brain today.

I made the calendar on this page interactive. Also, I changed it from using flexbox, which was somewhat convoluted, to using `<table>`. I remember that `<table>` started getting a lot of hate for a time because people (me, I was people too) were using and abusing it for grid layouts. But calendars actually ARE tables, so this feels right.

I'll be traveling for work this week, so won't plan to update this page, but I'll see what I can do to continue this daily practice and document manually, then share the updates when I'm back.

Wasn't feeling like doing too much today so I just did some more cleanup and deleted some old files. 

<h1 id="05">05</h1>

I made a [blank page](https://kwon.nyc/blank/).

<h1 id="04">04</h1>

Today I figured out how to automate the process I use to pull movie data from my Letterboxd into a JSON file that I can then use to display recent movies I've watched on my homepage ([kwon.nyc](https://kwon.nyc)). I 
* [added a line](https://github.com/rjkwon/blog/commit/421dcfb98a0385760103c30acd840b8534ccc80c) to my Netlify configuration to run a script at build time that fetches the data and dumps it into a JSON, which I'd previously been running manually, then
* created a [Github Action](https://github.com/rjkwon/blog/actions/runs/19931196947/workflow) to automatically trigger a Hugo build every morning at 8 am New York time. 

I also realized from days 1-3 that waiting until the end of the workday to do decadv stuff meant I was using my tired brain (my evening brain), so this morning I spent some of my good brain (my morning brain) on it, which was a really nice start to the day. I'll try it again tomorrow morning.

I had a long workday and then went to a late (for me) dinner, so I didn't have as much time as I hoped for to work on Dec Adventure. Today, I fixed the mobile view for this page. Also, randomly, while waiting for my seat at the restaurant, I saw the actor Wallace Shawn come in, talk to the host (checking wait time?), and then leave. Inconceivable.

I have this micro-site, [kwon.nyc/cans](https://kwon.nyc/cans/), that I put together somewhat shoddily several weeks ago. It's a series of photos of craft beer cans with neat designs in reverse chronological order. Today I did some unglamorous code cleanup, including fixing a weird datetime issue where the "Last updated" date was referring to the date of the last site build -- now it refers to the date of the last can photo added, as desired. (Cue applause.)

**Goal for day 1 is to build this log.** I stumbled upon this December Adventure thing on Mastodon, and it feels like a nice way to make some progress on things with minimal pressure, which is the level I'm on these days. 

I built it as a custom micro-site within my existing Hugo site, which is somewhat against the spirit of Hugo sites (I think) but is super easy and fast to spin up by just creating a new content folder with `hugo new`, a baseof.html and list.html in a custom layout, and custom css.

This is also an interesting exercise in GOOD ENOUGH because it is not conducive to navel-gazing pixel pushing (unless said navel-gazing pixel pushing ends up as something tangible).
