I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [DeployHQ](http://deployhq.com/) to generate and deploy the site, respectively, and [Github](https://github.com/) to host the source code ([changelog here](https://github.com/rjkwon/personal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)). Locally, I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to write and edit code, as well as Markdown files which constitute the content. (More gear and tech [here](https://usesthis.com/interviews/rachel.j.kwon/).)

This cool [illustration](../about/kwon.png) of my visage was done by my friend [Leigh Peterson](https://justafrog.net/), who also taught me [how to bathe a cat](cat-bath.png). (Those were two separate favors.)

I don't really use design software to design websites, but I probably should. It's just that every time I try, I find myself gravitating back towards designing in the browser. 

Typefaces I'm using are [New Spirit](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/new-spirit) for headlines and the [Apple system font](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/typography/) (currently San Francisco, I guess) for everything else.
