Since my last update to this page in February,

* Spring has passed, summer has nearly passed. I have been commuting into the office 3 or 4 days a week (more than the 2 days required) which has been really helpful for my productivity and general well-being.
* I got Covid (again ðŸ˜© this was my third bout). I took two days off work, drank a lot of soup, and watched all five seasons of the show Insecure. 
* I started seeing a therapist, again. I'd seen one several years ago when I was grappling with my career transition. I don't think therapy is the _only_ way to get better alignment between my values and how I live my life day to day, but it worked pretty well last time, so I'm trying again.
