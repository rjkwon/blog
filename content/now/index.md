Since my last update to this page in February 2025, I

- was in a car accident and sustained an acute nondisplaced fracture of the transverse process of my L2 vertebra, which means both that I broke my back and also that I am fine
- have had multiple health challenges (not including the above) for myself and in my family with attendant mixed feelings
- am hanging in there
