Since my last update to this page in January 2024, I

- left my old job and started a new one
- turned 40
- have tried to weather the turbulence of the American news cycles
- am spending another winter month in the Catskills, which is now becoming a yearly thing and is helping me look forward to this previously wretched season rather than dreading it
