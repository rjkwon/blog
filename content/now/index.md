Since my last update to this page in December 2024, I

- started taking an ASL class (the whole first session was about Deaf culture and etiquette)
- customized a new mechanical keyboard, bringing my total to 3 (not counting my numpad and macropad) â€” I think it's officially a hobby now)
- have been increasingly worried about my country and our world
