Since my last update to this page in August 2023, I

- spent a month upstate near the Hudson Valley and Catskill Mountains, so I've officially entered my 'I've been in the city long enough that I try to get out every chance I can but I still would never move away' phase
- became an aunt again and melted into a puddle of love
- haven't watched too much television as of late but I've enjoyed the following:
	- Fargo season 5: this is a Good Show (acclaimed, the one I'd probably say first if asked what I'm watching)
	- Suits: this is an Entertaining Show (formulaic but fun, good to have on in the background but can also multitask while it's on)
	- The Brothers Sun: this one is Good _and_ Entertaining (not that Fargo isn't, but Fargo takes a certain amount of focus to fully appreciate so I had to be in the right mindset to watch it)
