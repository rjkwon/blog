<div class="headline">Hi and welcome to my website. I am a queer Korean American woman of average height in New York City. Like you, I am also a denizen of the internet.</div>

In 2016, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/15/i-quit-medicine-heres-what-future-doctors-should-know">I quit my job</a> as a doctor (specifically, training to be a surgeon), which was one of the most important decisions of my life. It's one of the topics I could talk about for 20 minutes without preparation, which they say is the sign of a thing you're passionate about, or that you're a rambler (I'm both ðŸ’…). These days, I work in digital health for a tech startup.
