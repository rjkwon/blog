<div class="headline">Hi and welcome to my website. I'm Rachel, a queer Korean American woman of average height in New York City. Like you, I am a denizen of the internet.</div>

There are lots of things you can say about yourself on an About page but I'll tell you briefly that in 2016, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/15/i-quit-medicine-heres-what-future-doctors-should-know">I quit my job</a> as a doctor (specifically, training to be a surgeon), which was the most important decision I have made about anything (so far) and has shaped much of my adult life. 

These days, I work at Google, doing my best to make Search results with health information more useful for you. This work combines my love of websites (what is google.com if not a big website?) and my clinical product expertise, which seems to be a good thing.

Outside of work, I enjoy nonstrenuous nature walks, spending time with people who are important to me, spending time on the internet, tinkering with almost anything, riding my bicycle, being indoors, being outdoors, and many other things and activities.
