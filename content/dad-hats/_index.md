My dad has a pretty extensive collection of hats. A couple years ago he had an acute health event where he had to be hospitalized for weeks, so I went to visit home and help my mom. It was scary and sad. One afternoon at the house I was alone between hospital visits and looking for something to occupy time and brainspace and found many of his hats scattered in various places around the house, mostly closets.

I had a meditative moment with each hat, thinking about the significance of each. Some date back up to 30 years. Most are from places my dad visited â€” lots of national parks, some institutions that people in our family have been affiliated with like schools my sister and I attended, et cetera. Some are seemingly random, but all of the ones whose meaning I could discern seem to be associated with the things I know my dad loves: nature, travel, golf, education, Jesus, his daughters. Basically he's just a Midwestern dad out there trying his best.

My dad recovered fully from that event and is okay now, thankfully, but obviously we didn't know what the outcome was going to be at the time, so going through the hats was kind of a poignant and emotional exercise. It made me think about what it would be like when my parents are no longer on this earth and I will only have what they've left behind, which is their stuff, and me.
