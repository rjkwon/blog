  <div class="post-content">
<p>Lately I feel that more often I&rsquo;d rather re-read a book I&rsquo;ve already read before (and enjoyed) than pick up a new one. Maybe it&rsquo;s a form of risk aversion (I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to like a new book, so I&rsquo;d rather read an old one). Maybe it&rsquo;s something that comes with aging. I&rsquo;ve always loved reading books, since I was a kid and my parents would take me to the library and every single time I would check out the maximum number of books (thirty)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, read them all, return them within the two-week checkout period, and check out another 30.</p>
<p>At some point, maybe in college, I started re-reading books I&rsquo;d already read, although only rarely, and most of the books I read were in fact &ldquo;new&rdquo; ones I&rsquo;d never read. This is still the case, but increasingly I find myself going back to older books more frequently, and I believe this is a trend that will continue, although I hope I never get to a point where I <em>refuse</em> to read anything new.</p>

            <p>Same thing I just said in graph form</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In addition to reading a lot, I used to track all the books I read and publish very short reviews with ratings of said books on my website, which I then exported to Goodreads at some point, but then I kind of realized that not everything has to be social media-ified and seeing other people&rsquo;s negative reviews of books kind of took some of the joy out of the things I enjoyed that weren&rsquo;t well-reviewed. (I was also skeptical about staying on the platform after it was acquired by Amazon for reasons I won&rsquo;t get into here today, but you can probably guess.)</p>
<p>It also started to feel performative for me to publicly track what I was reading, and it became a bit Hawthorne effect-y<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (not so severe that I ONLY read books because I knew people were watching, but, because I knew I was being observed to some degree, I can&rsquo;t be sure that I DIDN&rsquo;T change my behavior because of it) and there are a lot of books I technically have read but honestly can&rsquo;t remember much of other than my gut reaction, and I certainly couldn&rsquo;t hold a conversation about those books today. Even reading my OWN reviews (that came from my OWN brain and were typed by my OWN hands<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>) is not helpful to jog my memory in some cases (oy). Also, some of them go back almost 20 years, and I was definitely a different person with different opinions and a more limited perspective back then.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the benefits of re-reading some books I&rsquo;ve already read is that it helps reinforce the memory of what I read the first time, or give me a new perspective. I tend to read a lot of nonfiction which is very amenable to this approach. I also have a much lower threshold to abandon a book partway if I&rsquo;m not really connecting with it, after reframing it in my mind not as abandonment but just a pause for now (whereas in the past I would have just tried to barrel through to say I&rsquo;ve read it).</p>
<p>I did recently migrate my Goodreads data to <a href="https://literal.club/kwon">Literal</a> because I do love tracking and documenting things. I also tried The Storygraph which I thought was pretty good but I really wanted a service where I could play around with the API, and unfortunately the founder <a href="https://roadmap.thestorygraph.com/features/posts/an-api">isn&rsquo;t prioritizing that right now</a>, which is totally fair (sounds like it was one-person show for a long time). I really appreciated that they shared that context when they certainly didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m re-reading Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which apparently I rated 3 stars in 2019, but am giving another chance for the aforementioned reasons and also I want to jumpstart myself into finding flow states in my own life again, so I have very high expectations of this book this time around to solve all my problems 😄.</p>
