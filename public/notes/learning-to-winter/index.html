      Wintering Better
    </h1>

  <div class="post-content">
<p>Over the past few winters, I&rsquo;ve been learning how to do it better. Doing what better? I mean winter itself.</p>
<p>Everyone just loooooves summer. If you have to name a favorite season (which you absolutely don&rsquo;t!! Who says you do?), summer is a non-controversial option. Bright sun, long days, beach time, et cetera. And spring is a close runner-up, with its warmer weather, greenery and flowers, and of course the anticipation of summer. If you want to be alternative and edgy (i.e., me in early adulthood lol), you&rsquo;d cite fall (or üçÇ<em>autumn</em>üçÇ, to put some extra sauce on it) as your favorite season, for its foliage, cider, pumpkin patches, sweater weather.</p>
<p>Winter is arguably the least popular season (again, who decided we have to even pick favorites and least favorites?! We don&rsquo;t!) ‚Äî it&rsquo;s cold, dark, and has a penchant for hosting various wildly communicable upper respiratory illnesses, which nobody likes (and for particularly vulnerable populations is not only annoying but also potentially fatal; I remember flu season in the hospital and it was terrible).</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, I have started to embrace <em><strong>wintering</strong></em>, which has meant entering a state of slowness and maybe more reflection over colder months, like a hibernating bear or a bird doing torpor (torporing? does one &ldquo;do torpor&rdquo;? Idk, and I can&rsquo;t ask a bird right now). Part of me always secretly liked slowing down, staying inside for longer, sleeping in a little more. Especially in the city there is often a certain pressure to go out and DO STUFF and be productive (both in a work sense and a social sense), and when I was more aggressively spending 120% of my time work-work-working to exhaustion because I believed that was what I was supposed to do in order to be a productive and valuable member of society.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;ve tried to reframe my attitude toward winter. This means:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Instead of thinking&hellip;</th>
<th>I am trying to think&hellip;</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The days are shorter and the lack of sunlight is depressing</td>
<td>An earlier sunset means I can slow down, stop working a little earlier (within reason), go to bed earlier, wake up later, not feel so much pressure to do go out and do things(TM) after work or in the evenings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It&rsquo;s too cold to go outside (and takes too much effort to put on all those winter layers)</td>
<td>I <em>get to</em> put on my winter layers, and I don&rsquo;t have to stay outside longer than I want to. It&rsquo;s generally quieter out than in the summer (and I really do not like crowds). There are no bugs outside and I don&rsquo;t have to feel sweaty and gross every time I leave the house. Falling snow can be beautiful. If I want to, I can stay inside and have a hot drink and wear fuzzy footwear while watching TV or internetting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Winter sun is weak and depressing</td>
<td>The light of later sunrise and earlier sunset is kinda soft, beautiful, and unique. I can have warm lighting that&rsquo;s not too bright inside that sets a cozy mood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Warm weather is so much better and more pleasant</td>
<td>I appreciate the warmer months when they are here, and the colder months when they are here, and I like having a balance</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Is this toxic positivity? Am I just gaslighting myself? Maybe. Sometimes when the sun truly hasn&rsquo;t been out in days, it starts to feel more gloomy and like the winter will never end. But it always does. It would be nice if society and our culture would give us more permission to semi-hibernate according to the seasons of nature, but I also think we as individuals often have more power than we think to do to shift our own mindsets about these sorts of things. Being a working person is probably one of the bigger challenges and relative blockers to being able to fully go into some sort of human hibernation state</p>
<p>I think ideally society would better support this type of slowdown or semi-hibernation.</p>
<p>Part of this is also a general personal shift towards being more in tune with my own body, which is something relatively new for me (or at least noticing it and being intentional about it is new-ish). If I&rsquo;m tired, I sleep. If I&rsquo;m hungry, I eat. If I&rsquo;m full, I stop. If I&rsquo;m thirsty, I drink water. If I have to use the bathroom, I go. I don&rsquo;t default to an alcoholic beverage at meals or as a social activity anymore (although I do enjoy a well-made cocktail, a shower beer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, or a hot drink with a shot of dark liquor from time to time).</p>
<p>What it doesn&rsquo;t mean ‚Äî two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t mean being disconnected or isolated.</strong>  While winter can certainly feel isolating because we are generally out less, it just means I have to be more intentional about keeping in touch, with the people who matter. To be honest, I have had trouble making social plans since the lockdown period of the pandemic (independent of the seasons), even though I used to be quite socially active. It&rsquo;s like a muscle that has atrophied that I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to use, which feels discouraging sometimes. Lately I have started making &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; to call or FaceTime friends, which feels annoyingly corporate and I&rsquo;m still trying to get over that part of it, but it has been nice to check in and see how people are doing and talk about how I&rsquo;m doing.</li>
<li><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t mean being cooped up inside and never going outside, or being physically inactive</strong>. I go for at least one long-ish nature-ish walk a day. Last year I did 30 days in a row of nature walks between December and January, sometimes multiple times a day. I think winter nature (snow, no mosquitoes, audibly quieter) is in some ways more pleasant than summer nature (sun and humidity, hella bugs). Having good weather-appropriate outerwear and access to nature are things I had not really prioritized until recently but it makes it a lot easier to be physically active in the colder months.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I have also tried very hard not to be a hater on summer in my discourse here, but I really do think it is unnecessarily glorified. I won&rsquo;t say no to an occasional beach trip, but I feel like it is not as chill as people romanticize it to be. I feel like I just have to accept that there will likely be sand everywhere ([<em>whispers</em>] <em>EVERYWHERE</em>), I&rsquo;m going to miss an obvious spot with the sunscreen, and no one can ever guarantee that when wading or treading water, someone else has not urinated in my vicinity, which I suppose is the case outside of the water as well, and urine is sterile and everything, but ‚Äî hey! I don&rsquo;t have to justify not wanting to peed near!!)</p>
