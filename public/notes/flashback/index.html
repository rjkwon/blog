The other day I was walking in the park and heard somebody yell my name. You know that moment when you see somebody totally out of context, like when you’re a kid and you see your teacher at the grocery store, and it takes you a second for your brain to adjust, like, “what are YOU doing here?! Teachers buy groceries too?”? I had to place this person mentally, but in that split second before I rememered they were a colleague in emergency medicine with whom I’d done a trauma rotation, I just had this really warm feeling (which is somewhat unusual because surgeons and emergency medicine doctors aren’t always… um… nice to each other).\nWhen my brain did catch up, I remembered them being a genuinely kind, hardworking person who cared about their patients and always treated other residents with respect, even when it was 3 am and everyone was physically and emotionally exhausted.\nLater, I also remembered us dramatically wheeling a patient with an open abdomen to the operating room emergently together. But in that moment, the overwhelming memory was that warm feeling1, and I gave them a big hug and we each went off in our separate directions without any further conversation.\nI also realize that, to other people, I’m a blip in their lives with which the only lasting memory is a feeling, so I hope I am living my life in a way that it is a warm and positive feeling, because there are definitely people I’d see to whom my reaction would be more like 😒 or 😑. ↩︎\n",
