<p><strong>An interesting blog post.</strong>
I liked <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/cities-need-more-trees/">this note about trees in Johannesburg</a> by Herman. In our last apartment, the bedroom faced a quiet tree-filled backyard despite the apartment itself being on a major two-way avenue, so I woke up to birds chirping and almost non-existent street noise, and a view of lush greenery.

<p><strong>Random thought.</strong> Personal health and personal finance are similar in that there&rsquo;s a lot of information asymmetry, but knowledge can be an equalizer and very empowering (and at the same time, having complete or near complete knowledge can only get you so far, even though that distance is quite far, because you can know everything about health or finance and still be physically or financially unhealthy)</p>
<p><strong>Nice things about winter hikes:</strong></p>

Technically, rectal temps are the most accurate, but oral or even optical is often good enough (can you imagine if temperature screenings at major events were done rectally?), depending on the scenario and the consequences of being wrong</p>
<p><strong>A moment.</strong> Riding my bike up the Hudson River Greenway the other day, a pedestrian and his dog stopped suddenly in the crosswalk, and I decelerated pretty quickly to pass behind them.
