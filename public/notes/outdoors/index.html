<p>I spent some time in the Bay Area this past week and did a vigorous hike (among other things). I was made to believe it would be more of a &ldquo;nature walk&rdquo; but this one, Mission Peak, had a steep grade and full exposure to the elements, and ended up being about 3.5 hours and close to 30,000 steps. I haven&rsquo;t challenged myself physically like that in a long time so I was pleasantly surprised that I survived.</p>
<p>I did feel like a real city mouse because my inner (and sometimes outer) monologue included lots of declarations of &ldquo;wow&hellip; it&rsquo;s just so&hellip; NATURE!&rdquo; alternating with &ldquo;dear god it&rsquo;s taking three business days to get to the top of this mountain.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>View from the descent</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I remember being at gatherings of my peers years ago and hearing them talk about hiking like it was a competitive endeavor, and immediately feeling inadequate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you done XYZ hike? <em>(Because that&rsquo;s the only one that matters)</em></li>
<li>How often do you go hiking? <em>(Because you have to go every weekend otherwise you can&rsquo;t call yourself a hiker)</em></li>
<li>Do you wear fancy expensive hiking boots? <em>(Because if not, you&rsquo;re not REALLY hiking)</em></li>
<li>Do you have a car? <em>(Because that&rsquo;s the only way to have access to ACTUAL hikes)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I think we were competitive about it because we were mostly just insecure and peacocking for each other. I definitely care much less about all of that now. It was nice to be on this particular hike and think whatever thoughts came into my head, including remembering those times and realizing I don&rsquo;t think like that anymore. Growth, I s&rsquo;pose. (I do sometimes feel the same way when I hear people talk about travel, specifically international travel for leisure, like it&rsquo;s a competitive sport.)</p>

<p>I feel lucky to live close to Prospect Park which I can <em>almost</em> get lost in and pretend that I am in an actual forest (until I hear horns honking or the planes overhead or other sounds of Brooklyn), and that there are lots of trees in the neighborhood.</p>
