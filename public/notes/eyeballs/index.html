Not me) was a tall Korean guy who looked like a K-pop singer1. I asked him a lot of questions about contacts and thankfully he didn’t seem to think it was weird that I was getting contacts for the first time, unlike the front office staff, who repeatedly kept assuming that I had already been wearing contacts for years and also entered my birth year in the system as 1994 instead of 1984, which I had to correct. Unintentional acts of micro-ageism, I guess.\nAnyway, I didn’t realize I had to make an additional appointment for a contacts fitting, and that apparently it could take an hour or more to put them in for the first time. Honestly, that was the most surprising part of the whole thing for me (as well as seeing the cost of contact lenses without a vision plan). How hard could it be?\nWell… it wasn’t exactly the eye scene from A Clockwork Orange, but it also wasn’t a quick dab-dab quickly followed by perfect vision either. It took me a good 5 or 6 tries to get the first one in. (Embarrassingly, I couldn’t keep my eyelids open, which sounds like an obvious mechanical blocker to getting a contact lens onto my eyeball but at least my reflexes are healthy, I guess.) I also kept having intrusive thoughts about how an eyeball is just a bag of water floating around in a skull socket, which did not help.\nThe associate at the eye shop2 was very encouraging and kept saying “You got this!”, which was kind, because I clearly did not got this. Eventually I did get them in, and was even able to keep them in for a few hours that first afternoon.\nSo, I now have the option of wearing contact lenses. I wear them about once or twice a week, for less than a full day at a time and usually only when doing the aforementioned activities including bike riding and hot noodle eating. Honestly, it’s… fine. Not earth shattering or anything, but it is nice to have the choice, even if I don’t use it very often.\n(I wore my contacts to a New York Liberty basketball game a couple months ago, and on one particular play the referee declined to call a foul on one of the visiting players despite what the crowd felt was an obvious hit, and somebody yelled out “1-800-CONTACTS!!!” which made me laugh. The hecklers at women’s basketball games are refreshingly nontoxic.)\nI have to say there was a moment as the K-poptometrist and I stared deeply into each others’ eyes (him to assess my astigmatism, me because my head was in a cage) where I momentarily forgot that I am quite happily partnered with my girlfriend and in my head was like, wait, Dr Lee… what are we? Then he told me that I should be on the lookout for impending presbyopia due to my age, which brought me back to earth. ↩︎\nThat is definitely not what the establishment is called… what is it called? Glasses store? Eyewear market? Vision place? Oh dear. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"877","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-10-22T09:01:53-04:00","dateModified":"2024-10-22T09:01:53-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rachel J.
