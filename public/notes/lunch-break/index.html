I probably could have set a boundary that I would take a true 30-minute lunch break, but I didn’t have that muscle back then.\nIn my next role, at Unicorn Digital Health Startup, it was more common to have lunch with colleagues in the beautiful kitchen area with the living plant wall and cold brew on tap, but I was only there for 6 weeks before the pandemic hit and we all had to eat lunch at home (and also live and work and play and do everything at home). Some days I would forget to eat lunch and then at 3 pm be like, why do I feel so horrible? Oh yes, I forgot to eat or drink or go to the bathroom (also, there’s that general crushing sense of dread from the state of the world).

Although previous jobs felt much more restrictive to me, and in a capitalist society it is hard not to internalize that we have to be productive or else we’re not valuable, I also see in hindsight that at least some of my reluctance to take a break was self-imposed.
