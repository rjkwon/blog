      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got contact lenses, for the first time in 34 years, as someone who has required corrective eyewear since the age of 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attributed the decision mostly to my ongoing midlife/existential crisis — as a way to prove to myself that I&amp;rsquo;m NOT set in my ways and I CAN do new things — and for whatever reason I had increasingly been thinking that my eyeglasses are my whole personality and I was interested in experimenting with a different look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just been living my life :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Seven sandwiches</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love sandwiches. Below are some of my favorites and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a few constraints I will impose to keep it to a reasonable number of sandwiches: these are limited to New York (not that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had amazing sandwiches elsewhere), sandwiches I&amp;rsquo;ve had at least 3 times, excluding burgers (are burgers sandwiches?), excluding falafel sandwiches (not that I don&amp;rsquo;t love them but I can&amp;rsquo;t pick a favorite spot and also then we get into wrap territory which is going to introduce too much scope creep), and excluding chain restaurants (not that I won&amp;rsquo;t crush a Subway or Potbelly sandwich if the mood strikes me).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chinatown breakfast</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we lived in Tribeca, I could walk to Chinatown for breakfast. In general I am a morning person who avoids crowds and noise where possible&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so I especially enjoyed being in the usually crowded and noisy neighborhood when it was on the quieter side with mostly just the residents of the neighborhood out and about, getting ready to open shops and stands and whatnot. You can get a great breakfast—you can get great food at any meal or snacktime—which is too often classified as &amp;ldquo;cheap eats&amp;rdquo; just because the prices are generally very reasonable (which feels pretty reductive, and dismissive of the skill required to consistently make a perfect soup dumpling or pumpkin bun or hand-pulled noodles or what have you). The other day we made the long and arduous journey from Brooklyn&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to have breakfast at Big Wong which is one of my favorite spots because it feels like a diner and I love diners. We ordered the crispy roast pork, which felt decadent, especially for breakfast, along with a salted pork and preserved egg congee, rice rolls with shrimp, and a plate of greens. (I&amp;rsquo;m getting hungry thinking about it again.) I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure the meal fueled the rest of my day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I walk around and do other things while brushing my teeth (which I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not supposed to do but I do it anyway, like using Q-tips to clean my ears) and the other night I was winding down for the evening, brushing my teeth and zoning out while walking around the apartment and I noticed someone&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; had left the light on in my home office and it kinda looked like a liminal space:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time in the Bay Area this past week and did a vigorous hike (among other things). I was made to believe it would be more of a &amp;ldquo;nature walk&amp;rdquo; but this one, Mission Peak, had a steep grade and full exposure to the elements, and ended up being about 3.5 hours and close to 30,000 steps. I haven&amp;rsquo;t challenged myself physically like that in a long time so I was pleasantly surprised that I survived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We joined the food co-op. I worked my first shift the other night (after &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; work). You choose from available shifts and sign up for the kind of work you might want to do. I chose cleaning. I had been somewhat apprehensive about working the shift, not because it was work, or even that it was work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to do or anything, but moreso that it was a New Thing to do and it had been a while since I had done a New Thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
