      <p>I love sandwiches. Below are some of my favorites and why.
First, a few constraints I will impose to keep it to a reasonable number of sandwiches: these are limited to New York (not that I haven‚Äôt had amazing sandwiches elsewhere), sandwiches I‚Äôve had at least 3 times, excluding burgers (are burgers sandwiches?), excluding falafel sandwiches (not that I don‚Äôt love them but I can‚Äôt pick a favorite spot and also then we get into wrap territory which is going to introduce too much scope creep), and excluding chain restaurants (not that I won‚Äôt crush a Subway or Potbelly sandwich if the mood strikes me).

      <p>One of the main reasons why I would find it hard to leave New York is that I have grown accustomed to having what feels like infinite food options and over the years have cultivated my list of good food spots in the city down to a tee.
‚ÄúGood‚Äù is a super subjective designation, especially for food. It can also be a sensitive and sometimes classist thing to talk about good food, so I would start by saying that I do not consider myself a foodie (even though objectively speaking I do think about food a lot and talk about it a lot and probably definitely spend an embarrassingly disproportionate amount of my disposable income on food because I genuinely enjoy eating so much).

        Chinatown breakfast

    </header>
    <section class="entry-content">
      <p>When we lived in Tribeca, I could walk to Chinatown for breakfast. In general I am a morning person who avoids crowds and noise where possible1, so I especially enjoyed being in the usually crowded and noisy neighborhood when it was on the quieter side with mostly just the residents of the neighborhood out and about, getting ready to open shops and stands and whatnot. You can get a great breakfast‚Äîyou can get great food at any meal or snacktime‚Äîwhich is too often classified as ‚Äúcheap eats‚Äù just because the prices are generally very reasonable (which feels pretty reductive, and dismissive of the skill required to consistently make a perfect soup dumpling or pumpkin bun or hand-pulled noodles or what have you). The other day we made the long and arduous journey from Brooklyn2 to have breakfast at Big Wong which is one of my favorite spots because it feels like a diner and I love diners. We ordered the crispy roast pork, which felt decadent, especially for breakfast, along with a salted pork and preserved egg congee, rice rolls with shrimp, and a plate of greens. (I‚Äôm getting hungry thinking about it again.) I‚Äôm pretty sure the meal fueled the rest of my day.

      <p>During the darkest parts of pandemic lockdown there was not a lot to do or look forward to so I put a lot of time and energy into making elaborate meals entirely from scratch.

      <p>Coffee is so good.
In addition to being physiologically and emotionally dependent on caffeine, I genuinely enjoy coffee. I have accumulated too many coffeemaking implements over the years, including but not limited to a French press, burr grinder, espresso machine, pourover cone, cold brew system, and probably others I‚Äôm forgetting that I use less frequently and are collecting dust in a cabinet. I started drinking coffee in college, mainly out of curiosity‚ÄîI had a friend who said they couldn‚Äôt function without coffee, though I perceived them as a very functional person, and I thought, ‚Äúhey, college is the time when you experiment with drugs, right? Let‚Äôs give this a whirl.‚Äù I really knew how to party back then. (My idea of a good weekend when I was in college was waking up at 7 am and spending the morning in the main library, then spicing it up in the afternoon to go to a different library, then going back to my dorm to watch Netflix DVDs and explore the internet for hours.)

      <h2>
        Brussels sprouts
      </h2>
    </header>
    <section class="entry-content">
      <p>As an adult I still sometimes have to trick myself into eating my vegetables. I made these roasted Í≥†Ï∂îÏû• (gochujang) honey Brussels sprouts yesterday that really did do the trick:
Í≥†Ï∂îÏû• (gochujang) honey Brussels sprouts
Here‚Äôs my incredibly imprecise recipe.
Í≥†Ï∂îÏû• (gochujang) honey Brussels sprouts Brussels sprouts (you could probably do this with carrots also or any vegetable that is good for roasting) Honey (or any kind of sweet nectar‚ÄîI used maple syrup this time) Lemon (or any kind of citrus/acid) Garlic powder Gochujang Wash your sprouts, cut off the stems, and slice in half the long way (if the bulbous part is a head and the stem is a neck, cut it in a coronal or midline sagittal plane). Check for aphids. If you have them, sorry. Dry your sprouts. You don‚Äôt have to go wild but the drier they are, the crispier they will turn out. I just blotted them with a paper towel and let them sit in the colander for about 5 minutes. Get a big bowl and dump the prepared sprouts in with enough olive oil to lightly coat them, plus a punch of salt and pepper. Some people say you shouldn‚Äôt salt before roasting because salt pulls out the moisture, like how osmotic pressure pulls water out of cells when there‚Äôs too much sodium in extracellular fluid in a human person, but I don‚Äôt think it makes a terribly big difference. The consequence of slightly dry vegetables is also less than that of massive intracellular fluid shifts in a human person. Roast the sprouts until they‚Äôre browned and crispy. In my convection oven at 425¬∫F, this ended up being about 30 minutes. While the sprouts are roasting, mix together the Í≥†Ï∂îÏû• (gochujang), honey (or maple syrup), lemon juice, and garlic powder in a small bowl until the consistency is similar to that of the honey. For a bag of about 15ish sprouts, I used a heaping spoonful of Í≥†Ï∂îÏû•, a similar amount of maple syrup, three shakes of garlic powder, and enough lemon juice to thin it out so that it was stirrable (I think it was half a lemon). I then added more garlic powder to taste because you can‚Äôt go wrong with garlic powder, unless you are serving vampires or strict Buddhists. When the sprouts are done, dump them back into the big bowl you used to toss them with the olive oil (ugh, I washed it already, this is what I get for trying to clean as I go), drizzle the Í≥†Ï∂îÏû• honey mixture over, and toss like a bingo machine tossing bingo balls. Serve, enjoy, and go on with your day. </p>

It reminded me of the time I was rounding with my interns and medical students in the recovery room after scrubbing out of a long case and I was hungry so I pulled an apple out of my white coat pocket, ate most of it, noticed that there weren‚Äôt any trash cans close by, and so I ate the core and seeds as well and then deposited the stem in the breast pocket of my white coat to discard later.
