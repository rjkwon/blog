First, a few constraints I will impose to keep it to a reasonable number of sandwiches: these are limited to New York (not that I haven‚Äôt had amazing sandwiches elsewhere), sandwiches I‚Äôve had at least 3 times, excluding burgers (are burgers sandwiches?), excluding falafel sandwiches (not that I don‚Äôt love them but I can‚Äôt pick a favorite spot and also then we get into wrap territory which is going to introduce too much scope creep), and excluding chain restaurants (not that I won‚Äôt crush a Subway or Potbelly sandwich if the mood strikes me)....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>Saturday, October 28, 2023</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Seven sandwiches" href=https://kwon.nyc/notes/seven-sandwiches/></a></article></div><div class=articles><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Comfort food</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>One of the main reasons why I would find it hard to leave New York is that I have grown accustomed to having what feels like infinite food options and over the years have cultivated my list of good food spots in the city down to a tee.
‚ÄúGood‚Äù is a super subjective designation, especially for food. It can also be a sensitive and sometimes classist thing to talk about good food, so I would start by saying that I do not consider myself a foodie (even though objectively speaking I do think about food a lot and talk about it a lot and probably definitely spend an embarrassingly disproportionate amount of my disposable income on food because I genuinely enjoy eating so much)....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>Friday, September 1, 2023</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Comfort food" href=https://kwon.nyc/notes/comfort-food/></a></article></div><div class=articles><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Chinatown breakfast</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>When we lived in Tribeca, I could walk to Chinatown for breakfast. In general I am a morning person who avoids crowds and noise where possible1, so I especially enjoyed being in the usually crowded and noisy neighborhood when it was on the quieter side with mostly just the residents of the neighborhood out and about, getting ready to open shops and stands and whatnot. You can get a great breakfast‚Äîyou can get great food at any meal or snacktime‚Äîwhich is too often classified as ‚Äúcheap eats‚Äù just because the prices are generally very reasonable (which feels pretty reductive, and dismissive of the skill required to consistently make a perfect soup dumpling or pumpkin bun or hand-pulled noodles or what have you)....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>Tuesday, May 16, 2023</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Chinatown breakfast" href=https://kwon.nyc/notes/chinatown-breakfast/></a></article></div><div class=articles><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Chili oil</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>During the darkest parts of pandemic lockdown there was not a lot to do or look forward to so I put a lot of time and energy into making elaborate meals entirely from scratch.

Now that I have settled into a new(ish) normal(ish), where thankfully there are other things with which to occupy my time than food prep, I have become a bit more of a utilitarian eater, in that I am less concerned with ‚ú® thoughtful complex flavorful meals that are time-consuming to prepare ‚ú® and instead more concerned with ü§ú getting sustenance into my gastrointestinal system ü§õ....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>Thursday, February 9, 2023</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Chili oil" href=https://kwon.nyc/notes/chili-oil/></a></article></div><div class=articles><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Cooperate</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>We joined the food co-op.

In addition to being physiologically and emotionally dependent on caffeine, I genuinely enjoy coffee. I have accumulated too many coffeemaking implements over the years, including but not limited to a French press, burr grinder, espresso machine, pourover cone, cold brew system, and probably others I‚Äôm forgetting that I use less frequently and are collecting dust in a cabinet. I started drinking coffee in college, mainly out of curiosity‚ÄîI had a friend who said they couldn‚Äôt function without coffee, though I perceived them as a very functional person, and I thought, ‚Äúhey, college is the time when you experiment with drugs, right?...</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>Wednesday, June 15, 2022</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Coffee" href=https://kwon.nyc/notes/coffee/></a></article></div><div class=articles><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Brussels sprouts</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>As an adult I still sometimes have to trick myself into eating my vegetables.
