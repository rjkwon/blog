I worked my first shift the other night (after &lt;em>work&lt;/em> work). You choose from available shifts and sign up for the kind of work you might want to do. I chose cleaning. I had been somewhat apprehensive about working the shift, not because it was work, or even that it was work I wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to do or anything, but moreso that it was a New Thing to do and it had been a while since I had done a New Thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flashback</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/flashback/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 06:51:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/flashback/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past weekend I met up with a few of my former colleagues from residency for dinner and drinks. It felt a little bit like a meetup with high school friends might feel, if you spent high school removing gallbladders and incising and draining abscesses. (Maybe you did. I don&amp;rsquo;t know your life.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a chance to confront and reflect on my former self in a controlled environment—in this case, a contemporary Mexican restaurant—was not a bad exercise. Part of me was hesitant, as my general feeling towards that time in my life is &amp;ldquo;thank you, universe, for the opportunity to learn about the world and myself, but also, don&amp;rsquo;t ever put me there again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tuesday</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/tuesday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 07:40:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/tuesday/</guid><description>&lt;p>The cadence of life is a little different now that I live in Brooklyn and work from home. In my 12 years in New York City, I have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>lived in Brooklyn and worked in Brooklyn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lived in Brooklyn and worked in Manhattan (the worst overall)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lived in Manhattan and worked in Manhattan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lived in Manhattan and worked from home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lived in Brooklyn and worked from home&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>and the one that feels most like not working at all is living in Brooklyn and working from home. The only thing is that, as always, the psychological barrier to completing inter-borough travel on a weekday evening feels insurmountable, even though it&amp;rsquo;s a subway ride that&amp;rsquo;s all of 15 minutes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
