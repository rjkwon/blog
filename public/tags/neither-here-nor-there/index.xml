      <description>I keep an eye on the news through peripheral vision mostly but I noticed something about the confirmation hearings of the honorable Ketanji Brown Jackson that required my focus:
Hon. Ketanji Brown Jackson&amp;rsquo;s husband
No, not the husband. The SOCK:
Hon. Ketanji Brown Jackson&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rsquo;s sock
I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what the design is (looks like some kind of illustration of a face), but what I do know is that it is a funky sock.</description>

      <description>Yesterday one of my colleagues in a (virtual) meeting reportedly picked up a canister of coarse sea salt, announced &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just snacking,&amp;rdquo; and proceeded to eat the salt, which confused and maybe frightened the other meeting attendees.
It reminded me of the time I was rounding with my interns and medical students in the recovery room after scrubbing out of a long case and I was hungry so I pulled an apple out of my white coat pocket, ate most of it, noticed that there weren&amp;rsquo;t any trash cans close by, and so I ate the core and seeds as well and then deposited the stem in the breast pocket of my white coat to discard later.</description>
