      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An interesting blog post.&lt;/strong&gt;
I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://herman.bearblog.dev/cities-need-more-trees/&#34;&gt;this note about trees in Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; by Herman. In our last apartment, the bedroom faced a quiet tree-filled backyard despite the apartment itself being on a major two-way avenue, so I woke up to birds chirping and almost non-existent street noise, and a view of lush greenery. In our current apartment, the bedroom faces a brick wall and a one-way side street adjacent to a one-way main street, so now I have a classic New York wakeup call which is horns honking, garbage trucks rattling, pigeons cooing and flapping, and occasionally people walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on the news through peripheral vision mostly but I noticed something about the confirmation hearings of the honorable Ketanji Brown Jackson that required my focus:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday one of my colleagues in a (virtual) meeting reportedly picked up a canister of coarse sea salt, announced &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just snacking,&amp;rdquo; and proceeded to eat the salt, which confused and maybe frightened the other meeting attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of the time I was rounding with my interns and medical students in the recovery room after scrubbing out of a long case and I was hungry so I pulled an apple out of my white coat pocket, ate most of it, noticed that there weren&amp;rsquo;t any trash cans close by, and so I ate the core and seeds as well and then deposited the stem in the breast pocket of my white coat to discard later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No, not the husband. The SOCK:
Hon. Ketanji Brown Jackson&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rsquo;s sock
I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what the design is (looks like some kind of illustration of a face), but what I do know is that it is a funky sock.</description></item><item><title>Power moves</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/power-moves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:28:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/power-moves/</guid><description>Yesterday one of my colleagues in a (virtual) meeting reportedly picked up a canister of coarse sea salt, announced &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just snacking,&amp;rdquo; and proceeded to eat the salt, which confused and maybe frightened the other meeting attendees.
