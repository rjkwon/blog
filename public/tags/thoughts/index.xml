Lots of things.
Primary name Most people call me Rachel. A certain subset of friends from a certain time in my life call me Kwon. I&amp;rsquo;ll respond to either.
Professional name My coworkers call me Rachel. From 2010-2016, a lot of people called me Dr. Kwon. Infrequently these days, some people in certain contexts still try to call me Dr. Kwon, or ask me if I want to be called Dr.</description></item><item><title>Wintering better</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/wintering-better/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 16:55:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/wintering-better/</guid><description>Everyone loves summer. If you have to name a favorite season (which you absolutely don&amp;rsquo;t!! Who says you do?), summer is a non-controversial option. Bright sun, long days, beach time, et cetera.

Increasingly I have been getting especially frustrated when things that are fancy don&amp;rsquo;t work, because I feel bamboozled.
The other day, I went to wash my hands in the bathroom at work, and the automated soap dispenser/foamer didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
