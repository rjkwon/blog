      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York City made a major change that affected every subway and bus ride overnight, but not many people noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened? Announcers were trained to avoid using gendered language, such as “Ladies and gentlemen,” and instead use greetings like “Attention passengers” or “Good morning everyone” prior to making an announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t earth-shattering. But I thought it was a great example of a small, easy, tangible way to be more inclusive, without being overly fussy or political about it. I didn’t even really notice it until I read an article about it in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
