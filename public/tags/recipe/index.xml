(It&amp;rsquo;s on my neverending to-do list for this website to make some sort of photo gallery of all those meals for posterity, but for now here we are.) Now that I have settled into a new(ish) normal(ish), where thankfully there are other things with which to occupy my time than food prep, I have become a bit more of a utilitarian eater, in that I am less concerned with âœ¨ &lt;em>thoughtful complex flavorful meals that are time-consuming to prepare&lt;/em> âœ¨ and instead more concerned with ðŸ¤œ &lt;em>getting sustenance into my gastrointestinal system&lt;/em> ðŸ¤›.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brussels sprouts</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/brussels-sprouts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 08:09:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/brussels-sprouts/</guid><description>&lt;p>As an adult I still sometimes have to trick myself into eating my vegetables. I made these roasted ê³ ì¶”ìž¥ (gochujang) honey Brussels sprouts yesterday that really did do the trick:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s my incredibly imprecise recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ê³ ì¶”ìž¥-gochujang-honey-brussels-sprouts">ê³ ì¶”ìž¥ (gochujang) honey Brussels sprouts&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brussels sprouts (you could probably do this with carrots also or any vegetable that is good for roasting)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Honey (or any kind of sweet nectarâ€”I used maple syrup this time)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lemon (or any kind of citrus/acid)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Garlic powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gochujang&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Wash your sprouts, cut off the stems, and slice in half the long way (if the bulbous part is a head and the stem is a neck, cut it in a coronal or midline sagittal plane). Check for aphids. If you have them, sorry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dry your sprouts. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go wild but the drier they are, the crispier they will turn out. I just blotted them with a paper towel and let them sit in the colander for about 5 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get a big bowl and dump the prepared sprouts in with enough olive oil to lightly coat them, plus a punch of salt and pepper. Some people say you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t salt before roasting because salt pulls out the moisture, like how osmotic pressure pulls water out of cells when there&amp;rsquo;s too much sodium in extracellular fluid in a human person, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it makes a terribly big difference. The consequence of slightly dry vegetables is also less than that of massive intracellular fluid shifts in a human person.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roast the sprouts until they&amp;rsquo;re browned and crispy. In my convection oven at 425ÂºF, this ended up being about 30 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While the sprouts are roasting, mix together the ê³ ì¶”ìž¥ (gochujang), honey (or maple syrup), lemon juice, and garlic powder in a small bowl until the consistency is similar to that of the honey. For a bag of about 15ish sprouts, I used a heaping spoonful of ê³ ì¶”ìž¥, a similar amount of maple syrup, three shakes of garlic powder, and enough lemon juice to thin it out so that it was stirrable (I think it was half a lemon). I then added more garlic powder to taste because you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with garlic powder, unless you are serving vampires or strict Buddhists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the sprouts are done, dump them back into the big bowl you used to toss them with the olive oil (ugh, I washed it already, this is what I get for trying to clean as I go), drizzle the ê³ ì¶”ìž¥ honey mixture over, and toss like a bingo machine tossing bingo balls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Serve, enjoy, and go on with your day.&lt;/li>
