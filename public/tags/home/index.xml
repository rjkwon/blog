      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I walk around and do other things while brushing my teeth (which I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably not supposed to do but I do it anyway, like using Q-tips to clean my ears) and the other night I was winding down for the evening, brushing my teeth and zoning out while walking around the apartment and I noticed someone&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; had left the light on in my home office and it kinda looked like a liminal space:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the top priorities when moving to Brooklyn was to have more space, particularly to have dedicated workspace. In our previous apartment, my office was a corner of the bedroom, which I was grateful to have, but also over time resentful. I love my work and my job (probably a litle too much), but seeing my workspace as the  first thing upon waking and the last before sleep made it hard for my brain to rest. (It wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as draining as sleeping on a twin bed in a call room in the corner of a patient ward with my pager on my chest, though, like I used to have to do during my surgery training, which is always helpful to recall for perspective.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
