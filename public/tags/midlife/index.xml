If you have to name a favorite season (which you absolutely don&amp;rsquo;t!! Who says you do?), summer is a non-controversial option. Bright sun, long days, beach time, et cetera. And spring is a close runner-up, with its warmer weather, greenery and flowers, and of course the anticipation of summer. If you want to be alternative and edgy (i.e., me in early adulthood lol), you&amp;rsquo;d cite fall (or üçÇautumnüçÇ, to put some extra sauce on it) as your favorite season, for its foliage, cider, pumpkin patches, sweater weather.</description></item><item><title>Eyeballs</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/eyeballs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 09:01:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/eyeballs/</guid><description>I recently got contact lenses, for the first time in 34 years, as someone who has required corrective eyewear since the age of 6.
I have attributed the decision mostly to my ongoing midlife/existential crisis ‚Äî as a way to prove to myself that I&amp;rsquo;m NOT set in my ways and I CAN do new things ‚Äî and for whatever reason I had increasingly been thinking that my eyeglasses are my whole personality and I was interested in experimenting with a different look.</description></item><item><title>Things I don't have to do</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/things-i-dont-have-to-do/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 22:14:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/things-i-dont-have-to-do/</guid><description>I spent a lot of time and energy in my life worrying about things I felt like I had to do for one reason or another. Either everyone else was doing the thing, or specific people were pressuring me to do the thing, or I never saw real examples or models of people who didn&amp;rsquo;t do the thing, etc.
At some point I started to realize that, if I really challenged myself, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do some of the things I believed I had to in order to win at life (and I would include the idea of having to &amp;ldquo;win at life&amp;rdquo; on this list).</description></item><item><title>My lil' midlife crisis</title><link>https://kwon.nyc/notes/my-lil-midlife-crisis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 13:49:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kwon.nyc/notes/my-lil-midlife-crisis/</guid><description>For the last several months I have been experiencing something, first in the background and now very much in the foreground, and that thing is what many people would describe as a midlife crisis, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel so much like a crisis mode and is in fact both exciting and exhausting, and fun and terrifying, and lots of other things.
I have a lot of mixed feelings about it, because I sort of thought I had already had my midlife crisis when I dramatically quit my career in my early 30s to TAKE A PRINCIPLED STAND and CHANGE THE WORLD and that from then on I would be sailing off into the sunset.</description></item></channel></rss>
