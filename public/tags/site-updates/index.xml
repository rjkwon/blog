      <title>Internet is fun</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun&#34;&gt;The internet used to be fun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like more people these days are starting to reject the notion that the internet is made up of Big Websites that represent Big Companies that are trying to take either the attention or the money of their visitors while adding minimal value to the lives and well-being of those visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a lot of us remember when the internet was mostly just fun, and the good parts of the old internet were by and large created by real individual humans who had no motives other than to explore the internet and just put stuff out there that was interesting and fun and random. We were just being curious about technology and the web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pushing pixels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made some minor CSS tweaks on mostly spacing here that have bothered me since the beginning (though not enough to get me to fix them until now, hehe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is extreme minutiae and probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t even warrant a note here but I did spend over an hour working on this so I feel like I have to document it. (I woke up at 5 am and couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep so I journaled and internetted for a while before deciding to fire up the old cascading stylesheet.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lo-fi changelog</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/notes/lo-fi-changelog/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/lo-fi-changelog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rjkwon/personal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md&#34;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a fun little morning project for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen others do a thing where the changelog is simply a list of all commit messages in reverse chronological order, so I decided to try it. With any &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; coding project, I find that I generally grossly underestimate the time it will take to accomplish a seemingly simple thing, but I learn a lot and also have fun with all the side quests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
