      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the many open tabs in the browser of my mind is to find an effective way to track the television shows I watch. Unlike tracking books read or movies watched or music listened to, for which there are several good options for products to use&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find a good product for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was on the internet in what could be considered my first act (a.k.a. the early internet, my teenage and college years from the late 1990s to early 2000s), if I&amp;rsquo;m currently on my second act as a citizen of the internet, none of these media tracking services existed&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the way we consumed television was still mostly on&amp;hellip; the actual television set. We&amp;rsquo;d have to wait a week between episodes of a show. It was basically the Bronze Age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
