The first image I asked it to make was one using the keywords korean queer mermaid liminal space and these are the four options it generated:
Four queer Korean mermaids, drawn by a machine (generated by Midjourney)
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing that a computer made these images, and that is obviously a marvel and an incredible feat of technology, although if you look closely you can see where it still needs a little bit of work (for example, in the bottom right panel the face is fairly well done, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the body or why the tail is detached, and the bottom left very much seems like the generator phoned it in).</description></item></channel></rss>
