      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a page for my dad&amp;rsquo;s collection of hats. It&amp;rsquo;s an idea I had back in 2023 and as is my nature, it took me way too long and too much overthinking to get it to a shareable state. It&amp;rsquo;s not finished, nor do I know what finished even means most of the time, and there are things I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it that need to be fixed, but if there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I know about myself, it&amp;rsquo;s that I&amp;rsquo;ll spin my wheels on the last 10% of a project that likely doesn&amp;rsquo;t even matter in the grand scheme of things. So in an effort to embrace this discomfort, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/&#34;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s for â€” I guess just to share something I went through. I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to play around with more evergreen content in general, and am also experimenting with more reliable workflows for sharing photos/visuals. (This is also challenging and I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to make decisions but I&amp;rsquo;m documenting my thought process &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0_FxxQm45FVvNV2VVJrvzUSpI95r4lttvi2wk3HMjs/edit?tab=t.yd8hhi20vc2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Work and think in public, I guess!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
