      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the top priorities when moving to Brooklyn was to have more space, particularly to have dedicated workspace. In our previous apartment, my office was a corner of the bedroom, which I was grateful to have, but also over time resentful. I love my work and my job (probably a litle too much), but seeing my workspace as the  first thing upon waking and the last before sleep made it hard for my brain to rest. (It wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as draining as sleeping on a twin bed in a call room in the corner of a patient ward with my pager on my chest, though, like I used to have to do during my surgery training, which is always helpful to recall for perspective.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; I made a new page: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kwon.nyc/bike/&#34;&gt;kwon.nyc/bike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2010 I was in my final year of medical school and had some rare free time for several weeks on a light rotation. My Local Bike Shop™ was offering classes on how to build a bike, so I enrolled and learned a lot about bike parts and bike maintenance. (Oddly enough, we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually build bikes.) Over the next few years I started building up a track bike, slowly amassing parts from my travels, getting the naked frame painted and framesaved, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
