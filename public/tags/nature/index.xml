      <description>I spent some time in the Bay Area this past week and did a vigorous hike (among other things). I was made to believe it would be more of a &amp;ldquo;nature walk&amp;rdquo; but this one, Mission Peak, had a steep grade and full exposure to the elements, and ended up being about 3.5 hours and close to 30,000 steps. I haven&amp;rsquo;t challenged myself physically like that in a long time so I was pleasantly surprised that I survived.</description>
