      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves summer. If you have to name a favorite season (which you absolutely don&amp;rsquo;t!! Who says you do?), summer is a non-controversial option. Bright sun, long days, beach time, et cetera. And spring is a close runner-up, with its warmer weather, greenery and flowers, and of course the anticipation of summer. If you want to be alternative and edgy (i.e., me in early adulthood lol), you&amp;rsquo;d cite fall (or üçÇ&lt;em&gt;autumn&lt;/em&gt;üçÇ, to put some extra sauce on it) as your favorite season, for its foliage, cider, pumpkin patches, sweater weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time in the Bay Area this past week and did a vigorous hike (among other things). I was made to believe it would be more of a &amp;ldquo;nature walk&amp;rdquo; but this one, Mission Peak, had a steep grade and full exposure to the elements, and ended up being about 3.5 hours and close to 30,000 steps. I haven&amp;rsquo;t challenged myself physically like that in a long time so I was pleasantly surprised that I survived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
