I don't sell anything or make any money on this site. I do use a cookie-free analytics platform called <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> for basic metrics. The metrics I am most interested in are referring pages (to see who cares enough to link to this site and to maybe make new friends ðŸ˜€), and visitor counts in aggregate (to get a sense of how many people are looking at specific things I've written, and, I'll be honest, to get a small but nontoxic ego boost). What I am NOT interested in is tracking what individual visitors are doing.</div>
